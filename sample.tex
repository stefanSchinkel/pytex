In the recent past, recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) has gained an increasing interest
in various research areas. The complexity measures it provides have been useful in 
describing and analysing a broad range of data. It is known to be rather robust to noise and 
nonstationarities.
Yet, one key question in empirical research concerns
the confidence bounds of measured data. In the present letter
we will suggest a method for estimating the confidence bounds of recurrence-based complexity 
measures. We will study the applicablity of the suggested method with model and real-life data.
